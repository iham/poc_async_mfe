# Proof of Concept for asynchronous composition of MFEs

Target of this PoC is a very simple Web UI consisting of MicroFrontend Components as listed:
- Header
- Navigation
- Content
- Footer

Those Components should automatically be added to a Shell Application on spinup of the MFE Container.

There are two branches as playgrounds:
- bitdev (using https://bit.dev)
- piral (using https://piral.io)
